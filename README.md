Google Apps Script integration with Slack to help with staging server management.

This is a second version of the [original script](https://github.com/thebookofeveryone/buttlr)
I did for TBOE long time ago. It includes more features such as server
adding/removing/renaming.

The commands now handle the servers by the name of them unlike it was done before
with indexes and fixed number of servers.
